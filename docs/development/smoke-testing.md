# Smoke testing

[Documentation index](../README.md)

These are maintainer acceptance checks for behavior that benefits from a real
Pi/herdr boundary.

Use disposable agents and exact-ID cleanup. Do not disturb unrelated user
workspaces or agents.

## Automated isolated smoke

Configure the smoke model once for the repository:

```sh
git config --local pi-herdsman.smoke-model \
  'provider/model:thinking'
```

Repository Git configuration is shared by linked worktrees by default, so the
same smoke profile applies when a Lead or managed Agent runs the harness from
another worktree. A user-wide fallback can instead be configured with
`git config --global`.

Override it for one invocation with:

```sh
npm run smoke -- chief-tree --model 'provider/model:thinking'
```

Run the live harness from a Pi session managed by Herdr:

```sh
npm run smoke
npm run smoke -- core
npm run smoke -- continuation
npm run smoke -- chief-tree
```

`npm run smoke` runs the default `core` scenario. The harness creates a
disposable named Herdr session with isolated Herdr configuration/state, Pi
configuration, and Pi session storage. It launches the current worktree's
`dist/index.js` explicitly alongside Herdr's Pi integration. The invoking
development Agent remains outside that candidate session and owns observation
and cleanup. The harness removes only resources it created.

The candidate Pi uses `--approve` for this one invocation, trusting
project-local files so project Agent definitions can be discovered. This does
not change the user's project trust setting. Pi's normal extension, skill,
prompt-template, and context-file discovery is disabled; the Pi Agent directory,
session directory, and Herdr XDG configuration/state directories remain isolated.
`chief-tree` additionally loads a disposable, root-only Pi probe extension;
managed descendants do not load the probe.

The available scenarios are `core` (nested delegation and candidate-extension
propagation), `continuation` (persisted Pi-session continuation across managed
generations), and `chief-tree` (current Chief/session_tree behavior).
`chief-tree` records ordinary Lead, Chief, and post-`session_tree` tool
snapshots and verifies Chief differs from Lead while selecting a pre-Chief
branch restores ordinary Lead tools. It does not
replace the broader manual Chief supervision checks below.

The harness must run inside Herdr and requires a configured smoke model or an
explicit `--model` override. The smoke model is independent of the invoking Pi
session's active model and reasoning level. Live smoke uses real provider
credentials and usage. Live scenarios may fail; running one is not
evidence of a pass. It does not replace or reconfigure the installed
Herdsman, copy normal Pi settings or extensions, or run as part of
`npm run validate`. Run selected scenarios according to the change being
verified; `npm run smoke` defaults to `core`.

## Preconditions

Verify:

```sh
node --version
pi --version
herdr status --json
herdr integration status
```

The `herdr status --json` output is the Herdr 0.9 CLI protocol compatibility
preflight. It must report a Herdr client version of `>=0.9.1`,
`server.running` as `true`, and `server.compatible` as `true`.

The supported repository contract requires:

- Node `>=22.19.0`
- Pi `>=0.87.0 <0.88.0`
- herdr `>=0.9.1`

Run focused tests and other intermediate checks before this smoke suite. Do
not format during smoke testing; complete smoke testing and review before the
final formatting and read-only verification sequence in
[Development validation](validation.md).

## Current mailbox contract

For a current managed run, inspect the persisted state, request, ask, and
result records and verify they use protocol version `4` and contain no lifetime
field. Control prompts use the `__PI_HERDSMAN_AGENT_V4__:` marker prefix.

## One-shot definition and session continuation

Delegate a small deterministic read-only task to the `scout` definition. Record
the returned agent, request, session, and pane identities.

Verify:

- one managed agent starts;
- the task is acknowledged;
- the agent completes with exactly one result reaching the owner;
- the terminal result identifies the exact session;
- cleanup removes the agent, pane, mailbox, and runtime;
- the exact Pi session remains available.

Use the exact returned session ID or path for a follow-up assignment:

```json
{
  "session": "<exact session>",
  "task": "Continue the investigation with one short follow-up."
}
```

Verify:

- the same Pi session and session file are used;
- a new agent generation, run ID, request ID, and pane are created;
- the saved logical label is reused exactly (there is no continuation label override);
- the saved conversation context is available;
- the current effective definition configuration is used, with omitted model and
  thinking fields restoring the saved session settings;
- exactly one result reaches the owner;
- cleanup removes the second agent, pane, mailbox, and runtime.

While the continuation assignment is active, submit another `continue` request
for the same exact session. Verify it fails with
`agent_busy`, creates no duplicate agent or pane, and leaves the active
assignment unchanged. After both assignments finish, `agent_list` must show
no completed idle agent.

## Historical session continuation

Use an exact saved session path or full UUID.

Verify:

- saved definition and cwd are respected;
- the saved logical label is reused exactly;
- session continuation uses the saved cwd;
- current effective agent override values are used for the new agent
  generation;
- the exact session continues.

## Managed-agent tool policy

Launch a delegating managed agent with an explicit ordinary execution-tool
allowlist and ask it to delegate one bounded scout task. Verify that it retains
those ordinary tools and can call all nine coordination tools plus
`ask_owner`, then verify that the spawned scout is a leaf with its normal tools
and `ask_owner` but no delegation tools. Also verify that role-required tools
are not removed by `excludeTools`.

For a definition with `tools` omitted, verify that launch does not add a
`--tools` option and Pi's configured/default selection remains in effect.
For an explicit `tools` list, verify that Pi receives the selected ordinary
tools augmented with the agent's required role tools. Confirm result delivery,
integration, and cleanup for all one-shot agents.

## Body reference expansion

Create a temporary global definition with a whole-line body reference:

```markdown
---
name: generalist
bodyMode: append
---

@../temporary-policy.md
```

Use a distinctive instruction in the referenced file.

Verify the agent obeys that instruction through the expanded private prompt.

Afterward remove the temporary definition and referenced file, confirm discovery
no longer lists the temporary definition, and verify no repository file changed.

## `ask_owner` round trip

Owner ask/reply remains manual, unautomated coverage.

Give an agent a task whose correct continuation requires an owner choice.

Verify:

1. agent calls `ask_owner` alone;
2. owner receives one question;
3. agent becomes `blocked`;
4. owner replies with exact `agent_reply`;
5. reply continues the same assignment;
6. agent produces exactly one final result;
7. no agent/mailbox leak remains.

## Delegating-agent turn ending

Ask a delegation-enabled controller to delegate required reconnaissance when no
other concrete, necessary independent work is known.

Inspect the actual transcript and verify the delegating agent:

- ends its turn after the assignment when nothing else useful is independently actionable;
- does not repeat the delegated reconnaissance locally;
- does not manufacture adjacent analysis merely to remain active;
- does not delegate substantially overlapping reconnaissance to another agent;
- does not poll `agent_list`;
- does not use `agent_inspect`, `agent_transcript`, or `agent_steer` merely to check progress;
- does not send "finish", "status", or equivalent progress nudges to a healthy
  agent;
- does not sleep or use another mechanism to keep the turn alive;
- the agent result resumes the controller session;
- integrates the result into one final delegating agent outcome.

## Useful concurrency

Delegate bounded task A and give the controller concrete, necessary independent
local task B.

Verify:

- B proceeds while A is active;
- B does not repeat A's assigned scope;
- once B is sufficiently complete, the controller reassesses instead of
  manufacturing more work;
- if further useful progress depends on A, the controller ends its turn;
- A's result resumes the controller and is integrated.

Also verify a controller with two already-known independent delegated objectives
may delegate A and B before ending its turn. It must not create a third
assignment merely to increase concurrency.

## Lead `/agents` commands

In a lead session with UI:

### `/agents definitions`

Verify the native Definitions selector shows:

- bundled, project (when trusted project discovery is enabled), and global
  definitions in the effective roster;
- project participation marked `[project]`, with `*` for a global override
  (`[project] *` means both layers contribute);
- compact, aligned name/model/thinking columns, including Unicode names;
- model, thinking, enabled, and details actions for a selected definition;
- `Inherit current session` for model and thinking;
- narrow panes remain width-safe.

Structured `agent_list` should still retain exact deterministic metadata.

Select a disposable bundled, project, or global definition and change its
model, thinking, and enabled state. Confirm that project discovery requires Pi
project trust and that these edits write global overrides only, not project
files.

Verify unrelated frontmatter and body remain unchanged, `Inherit current session`
removes only the selected field, fresh definition delegations inherit the
spawning controller's current value, continuations restore the saved session's
value, and running agents are not mutated.

### `/agents placement`

Open the native selector, change to the alternate value, verify, then restore
the original value.

### `/agents stop`

With disposable owned agents, verify the owned tree closes while an unrelated
herdr agent remains untouched.

## Failure diagnostics

Use a disposable invalid resource/launch configuration only when safe.

Verify startup failure:

- settles within the bounded budget;
- reports the stage and best available diagnostic;
- performs exact ownership-safe rollback;
- does not leave a false successful agent.

## Cleanup checklist

After every smoke:

- `agent_list` has no unintended managed agents;
- temporary global definitions are removed;
- temporary prompt/body files are removed;
- disposable herdr resources are closed by exact ID;
- no repository source file changed unless the smoke explicitly required it.

## Chief supervision live matrix

The manual checks below are **NOT RUN**, not claims of failure or success.
Automated live scenario results are separate and do not replace these checks.
