# Agent-definition schema

[Documentation index](../README.md)

This page is the canonical public schema for Markdown agent definitions.

## File format

A definition requires frontmatter beginning on the first line and a closing
frontmatter delimiter:

```markdown
---
name: scout
thinking: medium
tools: ["read", "bash"]
---

Prompt body.
```

Agent definitions use YAML frontmatter. Array fields accept normal YAML flow or
block sequences.

For example, block sequences are valid for array fields:

```yaml
---
name: reviewer
tools:
  - read
  - grep
skills:
  - "/absolute/path/to/code-review/SKILL.md"
---
```

Unknown frontmatter fields fail validation.

Malformed files fail discovery; Pi Herdsman does not silently drop one invalid
definition and return a partial roster.

## Sources and precedence

Bundled definitions:

```text
dist/agent-definitions/
```

Global definitions by default:

```text
~/.pi/agent/agents/
```

A matching project or global name overlays the lower-precedence definition.

An unmatched project or global definition is standalone. Project definitions
are loaded from `<cwd>/.pi/agents/` when Pi considers the project trusted.
Precedence is `bundled < project < global`.

All effective definitions are sorted and validated together, including every
`agents` reference.

## Execution settings

`model` and `thinking` are independent optional overrides. An omitted field is
inherited according to this precedence:

| Operation                                       | Omitted `model` or `thinking`          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| fresh `delegate`                                | current spawning controller session    |
| nested fresh `delegate`                         | current spawning managed-agent session |
| `continue`                                      | saved Pi session                       |
| any operation with an explicit definition field | explicit definition value              |

Model and thinking resolve independently, so either field can be explicit while
the other inherits. A nested agent inherits from its managed parent, not from
the root lead. Pi clamps a thinking level to the selected model's capabilities.
Fresh-delegation settings are snapshotted at launch; changing the controller
does not change an active agent.

`enabled` controls definition availability. A disabled definition remains in the
lead roster so it can be enabled again, but owner-visible definition lists omit
it. `delegate` and `continue` reject a disabled definition. An already
active agent may finish and remains controllable according to its current
available actions; disabling a definition does not mutate that assignment.

## Fields

| Field                   | Accepted value                                                        | Omitted/default behavior                                               | Runtime/composition behavior                                                                                                              |

`permission` is reserved for compatible permission extensions. Pi Herdsman
accepts and preserves the mapping but does not validate its internal policy
schema or make authorization decisions from it.

Arrays supplied by an override replace the complete inherited array, including
an explicit `[]`.

When a delegating agent declares an agent definition in `agents`, that definition must
be enabled. A delegating agent referencing a disabled agent definition can remain
discoverable, but is rejected during assignment or fresh agent startup with an explicit
disabled-agent error rather than being silently removed from the delegating agent
definition.

Skill and extension paths are passed to Pi unchanged. herdr does not resolve
them relative to the definition file.

Tool names are governed by Pi's native name-based policy, regardless of
whether a tool is built in, registered by an extension, or supplied as a
custom/SDK tool. When both fields apply, an exclusion wins over an allowlist.
Names do not need to exist when a definition is discovered: unknown names are
accepted and can match a tool registered later. Pi Herdsman does not provide
source-qualified permissions, such as an extension path plus tool name.
Managed definitions use `agent` as a delegation-policy sentinel instead; it is
not passed as a callable tool name, and leaf projection removes it from
explicit `tools`.

An explicit `tools` allowlist takes precedence over the default-selection
switches `noTools` and `noBuiltinTools`; `excludeTools` removes matching
ordinary tool names. Managed agents always retain role-required Herdsman tools,
which are protected from exclusions. When `tools` is omitted, Pi Herdsman does
not emit `--tools`, preserving Pi's configured/default tool selection. When
`tools` is explicitly set, the selected allowlist is augmented with the
managed agent's mandatory role tools. Unmanaged Pi launches do not receive
these managed-agent exceptions.

Loading extension code and exposing its tools are separate concerns. An
extension listed in `extensions` is loaded, while its registered tools still
must pass `tools` and `excludeTools` to be model-callable. Tool filtering is
not extension sandboxing: loaded extensions may still run handlers, commands,
shortcuts, providers, initialization, and other non-tool behavior.

Pi's native tool policy is the callable boundary verified for the documented
integration. A provider or conversion integration may add its own presentation
layer, so provider-visible tool descriptions should not be treated as a Pi
Herdsman permission registry or as proof that extension code is sandboxed. Pi Herdsman
passes the native policy through; it does not independently guarantee every
provider presentation boundary.

Tools with the same name are not independently permissionable by source, and
the winner for a name collision is not a supported ordering contract.

`noExtensions` disables ordinary extension discovery, but launcher-injected
Pi Herdsman agent and Herdr-state extensions remain mandatory infrastructure.
Explicit `extensions` entries remain separate launch inputs and are passed to
Pi normally. Launcher-injected infrastructure remains separate from the
definition's extension and tool policy.

One launch-derived exception applies, and only to an inherited model. Fresh
delegation inherits the spawning controller's model, and when that model's
provider is registered by an extension, discovery stays available for that
launch even when `noExtensions` is `true`, because a child denied discovery
cannot resolve a model whose provider only an extension supplies. A model
pinned in the definition is passed to Pi as written and keeps the definition's
own extension policy, so a definition that pins such a model must set
`noExtensions: false` itself.

## Managed-agent coordination tools

A managed agent must have a non-empty effective `agents` list to be
delegation-enabled. That condition is necessary but not sufficient: delegation
is disabled when `excludeTools` contains `agent`, when `noTools: true` unless
the explicit `tools` list contains `agent`, or when `tools` is explicitly
empty. Otherwise, a non-empty `agents` list enables all nine coordination
tools: `agent_list`, `agent_delegate`, `agent_continue`, `agent_steer`,
`agent_interrupt`, `agent_reply`, `agent_close`, `agent_inspect`, and
`agent_transcript`. Thus omitted `tools` permits delegation, and explicit
ordinary tools permit it unless one of those opt-outs applies. An omitted or
empty `agents` list always makes the agent a leaf. Every managed agent receives
`ask_owner`.

The tool name `agent` is configuration-policy evidence only; it is not
registered or callable. In `tools`, it opts into delegation when `noTools: true`
is set. `excludeTools: [agent]` opts out. When a definition is projected as a
leaf, `agent` is removed from its `tools` list.

`tools` and `excludeTools` configure ordinary execution tools, not this
mandatory role infrastructure. They cannot remove required coordination tools
or `ask_owner`. When `tools` is omitted, Pi Herdsman emits no `--tools` option
and Pi's configured/default selection remains in effect. An explicit `tools`
allowlist is augmented with the managed agent's mandatory role tools; the
configuration-only `agent` name is excluded from that allowlist.

## Body composition

The body is text after the closing `---`, trimmed at its outer boundaries.

For matching project and global overlays:

```text
empty overlay body
    → lower-layer body

non-empty overlay body, bodyMode omitted/replace
    → overlay body

non-empty overlay body, bodyMode append
    → lower-layer body + "\n\n" + overlay body
```

Standalone definitions cannot declare `bodyMode`.

## Body file references

A body line is a reference only when the complete trimmed line matches:

```text
@./relative/path
@../relative/path
@/absolute/path
@~/home-relative/path
```

On Windows, native backslash forms are also accepted, including `@.\relative`,
`@..\relative`, `@~\home-relative`, rooted paths, drive-rooted paths, and UNC
paths. References use the host platform's native path classification and
resolution rules.

Before bundled/global body composition, relative references are resolved from
the definition file that declared them.

When a new agent generation is constructed:

1. references are processed in body order; `~/` (or `~\` on Windows) is
   resolved beneath the current user's home directory;
2. targets are canonicalized with `realpath`;
3. each canonical file is included once;
4. a caller `delegate.files` canonical overlap wins and removes the body copy;
5. each accepted source must be a bounded readable regular UTF-8 file without
   NUL bytes;
6. included text replaces that reference line;
7. included text is not recursively expanded.

Every new agent generation expands the effective body and its file references
once at launch. Session continuation preserves the Pi session history while
using the current effective definition configuration; model and thinking follow
the execution-settings precedence above.

## Runtime prompt order

For a newly constructed managed agent, the effective launch composition is:

```text
Pi base system prompt
    ↓ effective body via systemPromptMode
selected project/global context-file additions
    ↓
shared herdr agent guidance
    ↓
<active_agent name="<definition>"/>
```

The final effective body and shared guidance are delivered through private
temporary prompt snapshots. The active-agent tag is appended directly as
interoperability metadata for compatible Pi extensions.

## Complete override example

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
description: Review implementation changes
model: openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna
thinking: high
bodyMode: append
systemPromptMode: replace
noTools: false
noBuiltinTools: false
tools: ["read", "bash"]
excludeTools: []
noSkills: false
inheritSkills: true
skills: ["/absolute/path/to/code-review/SKILL.md"]
noExtensions: false
extensions: ["/absolute/path/to/local-extension.ts"]
agents: ["scout"]
inheritProjectContext: true
inheritGlobalContext: false
---

Additional local review instructions.

@./prompts/review-policy.md
```

Because `agents` is non-empty, and none of the delegation opt-outs apply, this
managed agent receives all nine coordination tools and `ask_owner`, in
addition to the explicitly selected ordinary tools.

To disable a bundled role without copying its definition, use a minimal global
override:

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
enabled: false
---
```

The `/agents definitions` menu exposes the same enable and disable operations.
Removing the `enabled` line inherits the bundled value; when no source declares
the field, the effective value is `true`.
